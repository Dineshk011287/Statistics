In other words, interval scales are ordinal scales but with equivalent scale values from low to high intervals. For example, temperature measurement is an example of an interval scale: 60°C is colder than 65°C, and the temperature difference is the same as the difference between 50°C and 55°C. In other words, the difference of 5°C in both intervals shares the same interpretation and meaning.\n",

An individual with $0 has an absence of money. With a true zero point, it would be correct to say that someone with $100 has twice as much money as someone with $50."

It provides a measure of the central value around which the data points tend to cluster. The mean is sensitive to outliers, meaning that extreme values can significantly influence its value.\n",

However, it is highly influenced by outliers and may not provide a reliable indication of variability in datasets with extreme values.\n",

    "- Variance: The variance measures the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean. It provides a more precise measure of variability by taking into account the spread of all data points around the mean. However, because it involves squaring the differences from the mean, it may not be directly interpretable in the original units of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance and measures the average distance of each data point from the mean. It provides a more intuitive measure of variability compared to variance since it is expressed in the same units as the original data. A higher standard deviation indicates greater variability in the dataset, while a lower standard deviation suggests that the data points are closer to the mean."
